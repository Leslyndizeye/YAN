            <p>YAN aims to  tackle the multifaceted challenges of youth unemployment, malnutrition, and alcohol-related issues in Burera, Rwanda, by promoting creativity, innovation, and problem solving skills among youths, using poultry farming as a center of revolutionized critical thinking stimulation.

            <div class="about-content">
                <p> Collaborating with day-school graduates in Burera to address the specific unemployment challenges faced by this vulnerable group, further highlighting their contributions to the overall transformation of the district. YAN also partners with a professional veterinarian who will monitor the well-being of chicken and also teaches the beneficiaries of “One Chicken per family” the practicalities of effective chicken rearing for better production. For the unshakable sustainability of the initiative, YAN will target the “University of Global Health Equity, an American sponsored medical institution located in my home neighborhood,  and local restaurants as a market of chicken products to generate reasonable income that will sustain the project.

        <h1>Statement</h1>
        <h2>Targeted Issues</h2>
        <p>Inspired by the grappling high rate of poverty, violence, malnutrition, unwanted pregnancy among teenagers, and alcohol abuse, primarily fueled by lack of employment opportunities among youths in my home district, Burera, I believe that I should step from being a spectator to a problem solver. That’s how Youth AgriChange Network (YAN) comes to mind. YAN aims to  tackle the multifaceted challenges of youth unemployment, malnutrition, and alcohol-related issues in Burera, Rwanda, by promoting creativity, innovation, and problem solving skills among youths, using poultry farming as a center of revolutionized critical thinking stimulation. </p>

    <div class="solution" id="solution">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <h2>Approaches Used</h2>
        <p>YAN strategically employs poultry farming as a transformative approach to create employment opportunities for high school graduates. With an initial focus on 20 graduates from local day-schools, the project aims to break the cycle of unemployment and too much alcohol consumption caused by unemployment, fostering self-employment and malnutrition disorders mitigation. More Importantly, YAN’s long term projection is to introduce the innovative concept of "One Chicken Per Family" to further benefit every Burera family with a close-knit source of proteins to children, further reducing the high rate of kwashiorkor among children from my home district. YAN will also integrate the Agri-Innovate Speakers program–a program that will focus on inviting different speakers from different Agricultural fields across Rwanda, further equipping the members of YAN with agricultural innovation. </p>
